    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in beef and chicken stocks in a steady stream. Stir in fish sauce and soy sauce, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to 2 cups, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in vinegar, and season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place warm fries in a shallow bowl or dish, top generously with cheese curds, and ladle on hot gravy. Serve immediately.
