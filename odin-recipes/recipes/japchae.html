    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Japchae (잡채) is a classic Korean stir-fried dish made with chewy sweet potato noodles (dangmyeon), marinated beef (soegogi), and colorful veggies like spinach (sigeumchi), shiitake mushrooms (beoseot), carrots (danggeun), and onion (yangpa). It's tossed in a savory-sweet sesame-soy sauce and topped with thin egg strips (jidan). This japchae recipe is everything you want: authentic enough to respect tradition but easy enough to make at home just like my beef bulgogi. I use Korean glass noodles (dangmyeon) for that signature chewy texture, and I tested it to be doable on a weeknight-no crazy prep, just straightforward steps and accessible ingredients. It's visually stunning with vibrant colors and restaurant-quality flavor, and it nails the balance between chewy noodles, tender beef, and crisp veggies.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            250g / 8.8 ounces Korean sweet potato starch noodles (dangmyeon,당면)
        </li>   
        <li>
            100g / 3.5 ounces rib eye fillet, cut into strips
        </li>
        <li>
            1 carrots (120g / 4.2 ounces), rinsed, peeled & julienned
        </li>
        <li>
            110g / 3.9 ounces baby spinach, rinsed
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 red capsicum / bell pepper (50g / 1.8 ounces), rinsed & julienned
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 yellow onion (105g / 3.7 ounces) – peeled, rinsed & thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            100g / 3.5 ounces fresh shiitake mushroom – cleaned, stems removed & thinly sliced
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the beef strips into a medium bowl. Add the “beef marinade” and gently mix the sauce into the meat. Cover the bowl with food wrap and set it aside while you’re working on other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get the rest of the ingredients ready as shown below.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start cooking the prepared ingredients per below. Follow the order if you can. We are cooking lighter color to darker color (to minimize the color transfer and avoid washing up in between) and will be using only one non-stick pan/skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thinly slice the egg white and egg yolk like match sticks. Add them into the large mixing bowl as used above.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the final “finishing touch” ingredients—sesame oil and sesame seeds—to the large mixing bowl. Gently toss everything together using your hands to evenly coat the noodles and vegetables with the fragrant oil and seeds. Be careful, as the noodles might still be hot. If needed, start by mixing with a salad server and switch to your hands once everything has cooled slightly.
        </li>
    </ol>
